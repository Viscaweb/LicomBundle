## Enums

Some properties are ENUM using the following bundle : https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle

All enums are in this namespace : Visca\Bundle\LicomBundle\Entity\Enum

The full class name is made like this : 
Visca\Bundle\LicomBundle\Entity\Enum\{entityName}{propertyName}Type

There are some exceptions to that rule
